It looks like we've now covered all the core functional requirements of the assignment:

Simple Login

Task Management (Add, Edit, Delete, Toggle Complete)

Task Display (title, description, completion status, creation date/time, visual distinction)

Task Filtering (All, Completed, Pending with counts)

Data Persistence (using localStorage)

Technical Requirements (React functional components with hooks, responsive design, clean code, basic styling, no external state management)

The next and final step is to prepare your project for submission, which involves creating a comprehensive README.md file and deploying your application.

Step 1: Create/Update README.md
A good README.md is crucial for your submission. It should provide all the necessary information for someone to understand and run your project. Create a README.md file in the root of your task-tracker project directory (if one doesn't exist, create-react-app usually generates a basic one you can modify).

Here's a template of what your README.md should include based on the assignment requirements:

# Personal Task Tracker Application

## Project Overview

This is a simple personal task management application built with React.js. It allows users to log in, add new tasks, manage existing tasks (edit, delete, mark as complete), and filter tasks based on their completion status. All task data and login status are persisted locally using `localStorage`.

## Features

* **Simple User Login:**
    * Basic login form with username input.
    * Username is stored in `localStorage` for persistence.
    * Redirects to the task dashboard upon successful login.
    * Logout functionality.
* **Task Management (CRUD Operations):**
    * **Add Task:** Form to add new tasks with a title (required) and optional description.
    * **Edit Task:** Tasks can be edited directly via the form, pre-filling with existing details.
    * **Delete Task:** Tasks can be deleted with a confirmation prompt.
    * **Toggle Complete:** Tasks can be marked as completed or pending using a checkbox/button.
* **Task Display:**
    * Displays task title, description, and completion status.
    * Shows the creation date and time for each task.
    * Visual distinction (e.g., strikethrough, different background) for completed tasks.
* **Task Filtering:**
    * Filters tasks by "All", "Completed", and "Pending" categories.
    * Displays the count of tasks for each filter category.
* **Data Persistence:**
    * All tasks and the logged-in username are saved in the browser's `localStorage` and persist across page refreshes.
* **Responsive Design:**
    * The application is designed to be responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop screens.

## Technical Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js (functional components with Hooks)
* **Styling:** Pure CSS
* **Routing:** React Router DOM
* **State Management:** React's built-in `useState`, `useEffect` (no external state management libraries used as per assignment requirements).
* **Data Persistence:** Browser's `localStorage`

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vaibhav-bhosale1/task-tracker
    cd task-tracker
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
